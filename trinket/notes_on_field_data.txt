from runtime:
need field number to name for exceptions/printing
since fields: [ field_num_1 | field_val_1 | field_num_2 | field_val_2 | ... ]
                 ^- convert to field name ------^

____________________________________________________________

for generated asm (in OCaml for codegen):
need field name to number for creation and access of records and tables
so we can take { a = ..., b = ..., ... } and turn into
[ field_num_1 | ... | field_num_2 | ... ] on the heap

need field number to name for codegen of symbol table that C can use
^ this is the only case of number to name so just do that in its own part of compile_prog, no need to carry
number to name through compile_fun/compile_...expr (name to number mapping is still needed in those funcs though)
