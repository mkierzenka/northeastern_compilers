DESIGN DECISIONS / NOTES

 -- Records --
Did same trick as ELetRec -> use the "binding" expr type but in well_formedness() restrict it to only BNames

Well_formedness also ensures:
    - No duplicate field names within a record
    - No Blank or Tuple binds in records

New errors: RecordFieldNotName, RecordDuplicateField
